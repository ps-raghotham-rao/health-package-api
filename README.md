# Health Package API
A starter kit/ backend api for small clinics and medical shops. 
Which include:

# Doctor Appointment Booking API:

Patients can book their doctor appointment and tell general details about their query along with the appointment date.
In a database all the details will be stored. And the patient's details will be sent to the doctor/receptionist via a mail.
So that patient can be contacted later if appointment is available and further details can be contacted.

Best features of the api:
When you create a website. Sometimes in a free tier version some hosting providers won't provide email services.
You can use my api during those times also. Because I am using gmail smtp server. And no hosting provider's server email is necessary.

How the data is stored in the database.



# Ambulance Tracker:
In many countries, nowadays there are high shortage of ambulances in certain areas as the Covid 19 Cases are increasing.
So I have created an API which tracks all the ambulance details like vehicle id, locality or area it usually travels, trip count, distress count of the driver and more.
Which can be further used by the data analyst/ government to solve the issue like by adding more ambulance in that area or recruiting more drivers etc.

# Tester
This a question and answer API. Where patients can be pre-tested with a set of questions so that the doctor/receptionist can get to know a summary about the patient.
Then later they can be further categorized and tested appropriately.

This is very useful during this pandemic times where remote assistance is very much needed and the doctor appoitnments are rising in huge numbers.

Improvements to the API that may be done in the future:
Due to shortage of time could not build the front end.
Also can add constraints like giving if time slots are available or not for that date to be added.
Also sending medical report/ other files during appointment.
Server Email can be changed to user preferenced once. But the password should be added as an environment variable for security. Alternate way should be also done.

If you liked my API please support!
